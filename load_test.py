#The load_test.py file is used to test how well the calculator web server handles many users at the same time. It uses
# Locust, a load testing tool, to simulate multiple users making requests to the calculator's endpoints
# (add, subtract, multiply, divide). This helps determine how fast the server responds and if it can handle a lot of
# users without problems. It’s a way to measure the server's performance under heavy load.
